## Research Focus

I specialize in the intersection of systems architecture, software engineering, and performance optimization. My research explores:

- **Storage Systems & Database Internals** - Building next-generation storage systems optimized for modern analytical workloads
- **Distributed Computing & Machine Learning** - Developing scalable frameworks for distributed data processing and federated learning
- **Systems Performance** - Analyzing and optimizing performance bottlenecks in complex environments, including energy efficiency
- **Software Engineering** - Designing robust architectures for large-scale systems infrastructure and worklows/processes for people. 

## Current Work

As the Founder of **[Vitality AI](https://github.com/vitality-ai)**, I'm leading the development of [WarpDrive](https://github.com/vitality-ai/Storage-service), an open-source object storage service designed for:

- Modern analytical workloads requiring high throughput
- Storage disaggregated architectures (SDAs)
- Resource-efficient data management at scale

As the leader of this open-source effort with 10+ contributors, I:
- Create a welcoming space for both beginners and experienced devs
- Mentor others and write clear docs to help people get hands-on with systems programming
- In a world driven by AI, advocate for understanding the fundamentals
- Build a community grounded in curiosity and learning from first principles
- Keep everyone motivated by explaining why we're building what we're building

## Research Experience

**Research Associate, Indian Institute of Science (IISc)** (Aug 2024 ‚Äì Present)
- Working in the DREAM:Lab on distributed systems, federated learning, and energy-efficient computing
- Developed and benchmarked federated learning frameworks for client selection and aggregation strategies
- Conducted scalability experiments on Nvidia Jetson clusters to improve performance within fixed energy budgets

### Publications
