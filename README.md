## Research Focus

I specialize in the intersection of systems architecture, software engineering, and performance optimization. My research explores:

- **Storage Systems & Database Internals** - Building next-generation storage systems optimized for modern analytical workloads
- **Distributed Computing** - Developing scalable frameworks for distributed data processing and federated learning
- **Systems Performance** - Analyzing and optimizing performance bottlenecks in complex environments, including energy efficiency
- **Software Engineering** - Designing robust architectures for large-scale systems infrastructure and worklows/processes for people. 

## Current Work

As the Founder of **[Vitality AI](https://github.com/vitality-ai)**, I'm leading the development of [CIAOS](https://github.com/vitality-ai/Storage-service), an open-source object storage service designed for:

- Modern analytical workloads requiring high throughput
- Storage disaggregated architectures (SDAs)
- Resource-efficient data management at scale

As the leader of this open-source project with 10+ contributors, I:
- Create a friendly space where both new and experienced developers can contribute
- Build clear docs and guides to help people get started quickly
- Help junior devs learn systems programming through hands-on mentoring
- Shape the project based on what the community actually needs
- Keep everyone motivated by explaining why we're building what we're building

## Research Experience

**Research Associate, Indian Institute of Science (IISc)** (Aug 2024 ‚Äì Present)
- Working in the DREAM:Lab on distributed systems, federated learning, and energy-efficient computing
- Developed and benchmarked federated learning frameworks for client selection and aggregation strategies
- Conducted scalability experiments on Nvidia Jetson clusters to improve performance within fixed energy budgets

### Publications

- **[Flotilla: A Scalable, Modular and Resilient Federated Learning Framework for Heterogeneous Resources](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2022.04.003)** - Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, May 2025
  *A framework that outperforms existing solutions for federated learning across heterogeneous computing environments*

- **[Federated Learning within Global Energy Budget over Heterogeneous Edge Accelerators](https://2025.euro-par.org/)** - Euro-Par 2025 (To appear)
